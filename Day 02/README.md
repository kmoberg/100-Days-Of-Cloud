# 100 Days of Cloud - Day 02
![Day02](Day02.jpeg)

## We have a User Group!
Day [2/100] of the #100daysofcode and #100daysofcloud challenge, and to not spam my personal account, I’m moving all my IT related posts here!

Day 2 of the challenge is complete, and it has been an extremely productive day. [Bergen Cloud User Group](https://github.com/Bergen-Cloud-User-Group) is now a fact, and updates will come soon enough, but for now, I can share a peak of todays work.

ALL materials for the user group is OPEN SOURCE under the MIT license, and anyone is free to use whatever they want from it. Logos, presentations, labs - everything is open to the public! Even though no date has been set for our first meeting, I've started work on presentations and workshop materials, all on GitHub. https://github.com/Bergen-Cloud-User-Group
