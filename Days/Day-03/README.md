# 100 Days of Cloud - Day 03
![Day03](Day03.jpeg)

## Getting Started!
[3/100] Day 3 of the #100dayOfCode and #100daysOfCloud and we’re off to a great start! [Bergen Cloud User Group](https://github.com/Bergen-Cloud-User-Group) is becoming more real by the minute with presentations and lab exercises flying up in record time!

Check us out on [GitHub](https://github.com/Bergen-Cloud-User-Group) for all the content - open source, free for anyone to use or on Slack - link is in the GitHub repo!

On that note, After writing close to 4500 words in GitHub Markdown over the last few days, I cannot recommend the app Marked2 for Mac highly enough (#notsponored!). It’s a great tool to quickly visualize markdown in multiple flavors while writing, saving time and energy later when you realize you did something wrong.

Some of the cloud work today has been labbing simple things with AWS IAM, EC2 and VPCs, but things will become slightly more advanced over the next couple of days.
