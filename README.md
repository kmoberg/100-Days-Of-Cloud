## Karls's Cloud Journey

Who is Karl? Karl is a Cloud Architect and cloud-native developer based in Bergen, Norway who for the last four years has specialized in Amazon Web Services. He is an AWS Student Ambassador, 2x AWS Certified - as a Solutions Architect- and Developer Associate, and he **loves** to share his knowledge with others! As a result, he is a contributor to many local Meetup groups and has founded the [Bergen Cloud User Group](https://github.com/Bergen-Cloud-User-Group) a user-group where all materials are open-sourced so that the community can use however they want!

I started this challenge in order to further my understanding of of AWS and to work with technologies that I have not worked with before, and at the end of the challenge, my goal is to have a deeper understanding and feel more comfortable with some of the features I don't deal with day-to-day such as AWS Fargate, and serverless deployments and applications.
