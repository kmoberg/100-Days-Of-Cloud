## New Terretory
Day [6/100] of #100DaysOfCode / #100DaysOfCloud and it’s personal projects day 2!

Oh boy - Karl’s doing things he doesn’t know! I’ve been playing around following a couple of tutorials, finishing my Serverless portfolio using AWS S3, CloudFront and for a while Lambda!

It’s always fun to play with Lambda using Python and using the Boto3 SDK, I’ve been able to do some cool things with downloading source code from GitHub, extracting it, and deploying it to S3 - however, I realized after doing this that there must be a better way of doing this, and don’t you know, there is: CodePipeline supports deployments to S3 websites!

So now, every time my repo is updated, it’s deployed to S3 within a few minutes, it’s really cool!

**Part 2** of the day has been to play around with JavaScript, something I really don’t know well. I know some Java, and have briefly touched on JavaScript a while back, but nothing like this, so it’s new and exciting to try out things such as Babel and React. We’ll see where I end up in the end, but knowing from experience how useful JavaScript can be, it’s a fun challenge.

Please consider following @cloudkarl for daily updates!

Also - side note: I’ve been using Adobe Lightroom CC (Cloud) to manage my photos. If you do use it, consider switching. I realized today that I’ve lost about 1,000 raw photos from there because of their horrible Cloud solution. The only reason I haven’t lost my child’s 4th birthday photos is because I’m lazy and have a gigantic memory card, so I haven’t had to format it yet - if I had, I would have lost those too.
