# 100 Days of Cloud - Day 05
![Day 05](Day05.jpeg)

## Personal Project Day!
I've taken today off from working on the user group, to focus on myself, and I think that has been a really good idea.
Starting out today, I felt that I wasn't "feeling it" to start work on more labs, but instead of taking the entire day off, I decided to look up things I have little experience with - for example hosting my own blog with S3 and Lambda, and what do you know - there are plenty of good sources out there for just this!

I went with [A Cloud Guru](https://acloud.guru)'s guide for creating a simple static website with React and Lambda, but there are so many others out there. Although I didn't have time to complete the project today, I think I'm going to spend the next couple of days working on this idea - running a site completely serverlessly (is that even a word? Probably not.) and expand on it to replace the Wordpress installation that I despise for my current "blog".

The current site is built using React, S3, Lambda, CloudFront and Route53, but this will surely be expanded upon over the next few days. It's a really cool challenge, when you have the time to do it, coming from someone who isn't a traditional full-time programmer.
